########## Numerical Features

1. PassengerId
   To drop as irrelevant

2. 'Survived' (Target)
    Observations: We note that the target variable is not balanced. We need to use some undersampling or oversampling techniques
    
3. 'Pclass'
    Observations
    There are a higher no. of 3rd class than 1st and 2nd class combined.
    There are higher no. of first class than second class passengers
    The raw count suggests that being in 1st class gives the highest chance of survival, while the chances of survival decreases the lower your class
    
4. 'Age' (MISSING VALUES - OUTLIERS PRESENT - median)
    - Since Age has some outliers, we use the median to impute the missing values, meanwhile we impute missing values in "Embarked" with S
    The distribution chart confirms that most of the passanger age is between "26-36" in the data.
    The chart confirms that the passanger whose age between "26-36"are more likely survived.
    The chart confirms that the passanger whose age more than "62" are more likely dead.
    
    
5. 'SibSp'
    Observations
    Majority of the passengers do not have siblings/spouse. Roughly 32% have at least one sibling/spouse.
    Out of those that died, a higher percentage of them do not have a sibling/spouse
    55% of the people that have siblings/spouse survive, while only 45% of those that do not have siblings/spouse survive.
    We can conclude that having siblings/spouses will have higher odds of survival.
    On further inspection, we notice that those that have 2 or more siblings/spouse have higher odds of survival
    
6. 'Parch'
    Observations
    From the data, we notice that a higher percentage of people that did not survive did not have parents/children. Although a higher percentage of people that had parents/children also did not survive, the percentage of people that were alone that died is still higher
    On closer inspection, we notice that family sizes between 2 and 4 had the highest chances of survival. Singles, and those that had family sizes of 5 and more have lower chances of survival

7. 'Fare'
     The distribution chart confirms that we have a higher no. of "1" than other in the data.
     The chart confirms that whose fare is "2" are more likely survived.
     The chart confirms that whose fare is "5" are more likely dead.

########## Categorical Features

1. 'Name'
    Confirms our earlier finding that females tend to have a higher survival rate
    Highest title count = "Mr"
    Males that have the 'master' or 'dr' title tend to have higher surival rates
    Individuals with more prestigious titles have a higher survial rate
    
    
2. 'Sex'
    Observations:
    There are different no. of males and females
    Females are more likely to survive compared to males
    
3. 'Ticket'
    To drop as irrelevant


4. 'Cabin'
    More than 40 % of missing values. Only first class passengers have cabins, the rest are unknown.
    
    
5. 'Embarked' (MISSING VALUES PRESENT - FILL WITH MODE)
    There are a larger proportion of passengers that have embarked from southampton. Queenstown has the least
    Those that embarked from Queenstown and Southampton have a higher chance of dying. Those from southamption have a slightly higher chance of survival
    
    
    
########## Notable points

- Since Age has some outliers, we use the median to impute the missing values, meanwhile we impute missing values in "Embarked" with S

- "Cabin" column has too many missing features. We have to drop this feature.
  "Ticket" is also dropped due to irrelevance
  "PassengerId" is also dropped
  
- UNDERSAMPLE TO IMPROVE ACCURACY
